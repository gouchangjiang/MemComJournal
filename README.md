This is for the paper published on TPDS. All codes are here. And you can download the trees from

Dataset from this link include not noly trees used in the paper but also some other trees. They share the same format as the one above, except colunms represent id_node, id_parent_node, memory_size_of_task, memory_size_of_outgoing_edge, processing_time_of_node.
